## 🚀 Project Overview
Customer segmentation is a powerful technique used by businesses to understand customer behavior and create **personalized marketing strategies**.  
In this project, customers are grouped into meaningful segments using **unsupervised machine learning algorithms** such as **K-Means** and **Hierarchical Clustering**.

The project converts raw numerical customer data into **actionable business insights**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
✅ Preprocess and normalize numerical data  
✅ Determine the optimal number of clusters  
✅ Apply clustering algorithms  
✅ Visualize clusters in 2D and 3D  
✅ Interpret and label customer segments  

---

## 🧠 Techniques Used
- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Hierarchical (Agglomerative) Clustering**
- **Elbow Method**
- **Silhouette Score**
- **PCA (2D & 3D Visualization)**
- **t-SNE (Advanced Visualization)**

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains numerical customer attributes such as:
- Income-related features  
- Spending behavior  
- Purchase frequency  

📌 *Only numerical features were used after preprocessing and normalization.*

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

### 🔹 1. Data Preprocessing
- Selected numerical features  
- Handled missing values  
- Normalized data using **StandardScaler**

---

### 🔹 2. Optimal Cluster Selection
- **Elbow Method** to find ideal number of clusters  
- **Silhouette Score** to validate clustering quality  

---

### 🔹 3. Clustering
- Applied **K-Means** for customer segmentation  
- Used **Hierarchical Clustering** for comparison  

---

### 🔹 4. Visualization
- **PCA (2D & 3D)** for dimensionality reduction  
- **t-SNE** for enhanced visual clarity  

---

### 🔹 5. Cluster Interpretation & Labeling
Each cluster was analyzed and labeled based on behavior:

🟢 **High-Value Customers**  
🔵 **Bargain Seekers**  
🟡 **Low Engagement Customers**

---

## 📊 Key Insights
✨ High-value customers contribute maximum revenue  
✨ Bargain seekers respond best to discounts  
✨ Low-engagement customers need reactivation strategies  

---

## 💼 Business Impact
📌 Enables targeted marketing  
📌 Improves customer retention  
📌 Supports data-driven decision-making  
📌 Enhances customer experience
